Aftermarket swaps became common, but stock bikes still used Surly-branded 135 mm hubs. Forks & Aftermarket Options OEM forks remained 135 mm with 17.5 mm offset . Aftermarket 100 mm forks were available separately, but \u201cno complete Pugsley bike rolled off the Surly line with a 100 mm front.\u201d (Original CPSC recall: https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Surly-Bikes-Recalls-Bicycle-Forks/ , Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20130509000000/https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Surly-Bikes-Recalls-Bicycle-Forks/ ) Head Tube The Pugsley retained a straight 1 \u215b\u2033 head tube ; no factory builds used a tapered steerer.

Seat-Tube Reinforcing Tube (\u201cGusset\u201d) Starting in the 2011 model year, Surly added a small chromoly gusset (a reinforcing tube) between the seat tube and top tube to reduce stress at the seat-stay junction. This is the same style of \u201cseat-tube reinforcing tube\u201d Surly had already introduced on the Ogre and ECR frames. \u201c2010 also saw a modest redesign of the Pugsley incorporating the seat tube reinforcing tube\u2026 as well as some changes to the brazons to make the Pug even more versatile.\u201d (Original: https://fullspectrumcycling.com/surly-pugsley/ , Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20240501000000/https://fullspectrumcycling.com/surly-pugsley/ ) Many owners reported small cracks \u201cjust behind the seat stay \u2026 right where the failures were on some 2010 frames.\u201d Surly\u2019s solution was this gusset\u2014no geometry or dropout width was altered.

Surly introduced the Moonlander as a higher-end sibling in early 2015, but the Pugsley frame\u2019s core dimensions (dropout spacing, head tube, chainstay shape) stayed the same through 2016. Head Tube & Forks Throughout this period, the Pugsley\u2019s head tube remained straight 1 \u215b\u2033 \u2014no tapered head tube ever appeared on a factory Pugsley.

Inventory cleared out through early 2017.
