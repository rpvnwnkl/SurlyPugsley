From the very first production frames, Surly built the Pugsley around 135 mm rear spacing : \u201cSurly\u2019s Pugsley frames have a head tube designed to accommodate a fork with a standard 1 1/8\u2033 steerer tube, and are built around 135 mm rear spacing.\u201d Fork Specification The factory-spec fork was also built to 135 mm spacing with ~17.5 mm offset. Aftermarket 100 mm Pugsley forks existed but \u201cwere sold individually only\u2014no complete bike ever shipped from the factory with a 100 mm front end.\u201d Head Tube Every Pugsley frame used a straight 1 1/8\u2033 head tube ; \u201cAt no point did Surly build a Pugsley with a tapered head tube.\u201d Wheels & Brakes Standard \u201cRat Ride\u201d rims (80 mm internal) and Surly hubs were spec\u2019d for 26 \u00d7 4.7\u2033 or similar tires, all on 135 mm dropout spacing, meaning front and rear wheels were interchangeable. Post-mount disc was the only brake option (no cantilever bosses). 2007\u20132010: \u201807\u2013\u201910 Models\u2014Tweaks Without Spacing Changes \u00b6 Geometry & Chainstay Minor adjustments to top-tube length and head tube angle occurred through these years, but rear dropout spacing remained 135 mm . Owners sometimes referred to the early chainstay curve as \u201ctaco-flat\u201d when running very wide tires. Forks & Aftermarket Options Surly continued producing the 135 mm fork for complete builds; aftermarket 100 mm Pugsley forks were offered \u201cas separate items only.\u201d Head Tube Still a straight 1 1/8\u2033 head tube \u2014no factory-shipped tapered steerer. 2011\u20132013: Component Refreshes, Same Core Frame \u00b6 Component Spec Updates By 2011, Surly had largely phased out in-house hubs in favor of aftermarket options (Hadley, Phil Wood, etc.), but the frame still rode on 135 mm spacing front and rear. Drivetrain spec began shifting toward 1\u00d710/1\u00d711 as those groupsets matured, yet remained fully compatible with the existing 135 mm hubs. Fork & Head Tube OEM forks remained 135 mm with straight 1 1/8\u2033 steerer . \u201cSurly Pugsley 100 mm bicycle forks were sold individually only\u2026 Surly Pugsley 135 mm bicycle forks were sold individually and as part of 2013 model year complete bicycles.\u201d Frame Updates Minor reinforcement gussets around the head tube and seat tube junction appeared, but geometry and spacing were unchanged from earlier years. 2014\u20132016: Final Production Run\u2014Last of the True Pugsleys \u00b6 2014 Model Year Small paint and decal changes (e.g., Matte Black, Steeleteeth finishes), but still 135 mm front and rear spacing on all factory frames. 2015\u20132016 Spec Evolutions Spec kits continued evolving\u20141\u00d711 and 1\u00d712 drivetrains became common\u2014but frames remained built around 135 mm spacing . Surly introduced the Moonlander as a higher-end sibling in 2015, yet the Pugsley frame\u2019s core dimensions (including dropouts and head tube) stayed the same. Head Tube & Forks Throughout this period, the Pugsley\u2019s head tube remained straight 1 1/8\u2033 ; no tapered head tube appeared on any factory Pugsley. \u201cThe Surly Pugsley has a head tube designed to accommodate a fork with a standard 1 1/8\u2033 steerer tube.\u201d 2017: Discontinuation\u2014Cult Status Achieved \u00b6 End of Production Surly officially discontinued the Pugsley after the 2016 model year; inventory cleared out through early 2017. By this point, \u201cmost factory engineers and dealers had moved on to the Moonlander, Ice Cream Truck, and other fat-bike models,\u201d leaving the Pugsley as a beloved platform for aftermarket modifications. Legacy Because every factory Pugsley used 135 mm spacing front and rear, aftermarket hub makers like Industry Nine and Hope provided easily dished 135 mm fat hubs, keeping Pugsleys rolling long after production ended. Key Takeaways \u00b6 Always 135 mm Spacing Front & Rear From 2005\u20132016, every factory Pugsley frame and fork shipped with 135 mm spacing , both front and rear. Any 100 mm Pugsley forks on the market were aftermarket-only \u2014no complete Pugsley ever left Surly with a 100 mm front. Always a Straight 1 1/8\u2033 Head Tube Pugsley never featured a tapered head tube in OEM builds. All factory frames used a straight 1 1/8\u2033 head tube throughout its production run. Chainstay Curve (\u201cTaco-Flat\u201d) Early Pugsleys (2005\u20132010) had a pronounced chainstay curve for tire clearance\u2014owners dubbed it \u201ctaco-flat\u201d when very wide rubber nearly touched the chainstay. This characteristic chainstay design stayed consistent through 2016. Component Evolution, Not Frame Evolution Most perceived \u201credesigns\u201d were spec updates\u2014new hubs, new drivetrains, fresh paint\u2014not fundamental frame changes. Core geometry (dropout spacing, head tube, chainstay design) was essentially unchanged from introduction to discontinuation.
