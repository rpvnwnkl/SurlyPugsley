# Pugsley FAQs & Recurring Topics

**Q: Is the Pugsley obsolete compared to symmetrical fat bikes?**  
A: Offset frames still shine in expedition use and field repairs—real-world benefit > tabletop specs.

**Q: Why so heavy? Can I lighten it?**  
A: Steel + big tires = durability. Typical mods: lighter rims, 1× drivetrain, minimal accessories, single-speed.

**Q: How does the offset affect handling?**  
A: Slight “waggle” at low speeds, quickly forgotten in ride. Tires and weight impact feel more.

**Q: What BB/crank choices reduce Q-factor?**  
A: MWOD/OD cranks modify stance; narrow BBs exist but limit tire clearance.

**Q: Can I use a suspension fork?**  
A: Yes, but geometry changes. Trials exist with Bluto/Mastodon—expect different handling.

**Q: Where do I find offset rims today?**  
A: Surly MOBD, used Large Marge; any center-drilled rim works if you dish for offset.
