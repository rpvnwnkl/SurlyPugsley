# Frame Reinforcements & Gussets

Between 2011–2013, Surly introduced a small reinforcing tube (gusset) on the Pugsley’s seat-tube/top-tube junction. Below is everything we know about it:

## Why the Gusset?

- **Crack Reports on 2010 Frames**  
  • Multiple owners posted about small frame cracks “just behind the seat stay … right where the failures were on the 2010 models.”

- **Surly’s Solution**  
  • “2010 also saw a modest redesign of the Pugsley incorporating the seat tube reinforcing tube, seen on several new Surly designs…”

## What Exactly Changed

1. **Seat-Tube Reinforcing Tube**  
   - A short, 19 mm OD chromoly tube is brazed between the seat tube and top tube, just above the weld where the seat stays meet the seat tube.  
   - This “gusset” spreads weld stress over a larger area, reducing the chance of fatigue cracks.  

2. **Comparison Photos**  
   - *Pre-2010 frame (no gusset)* vs. *2011–2013 frame (with gusset)*

3. **Other Minor Weld/Tubing Tweaks**  
   - Head-tube and top-tube intersections retained the same straight 1 ⅛″ steerer and 69°–70° head-tube angle—no extra gussets were added there.  
   - Chainstay curve, dropout width (135 mm), and all other geometry points remained identical.

## How to Identify a Gusseted Frame

- Look at the seat-tube/top-tube junction from the non-drive side:  
  - If you see a small “helper tube” running parallel to the top tube for ~50 mm before joining the seat tube, that’s a reinforcement tube.  
  - If not, you have a 2005–2010 model (no gusset).

- Serial numbers for gusseted frames usually begin with “PUG11” or later, indicating 2011+ production.

## Is It Worth Worrying About?

- By 2012, Surly had the gusset geometry dialed in—failures became very rare.  
- If you own a 2010 frame, consider checking that exact weld area regularly.  
- If you have a 2011+ frame, visually inspect once a year for any crack propagation around the gusset-to-seat-tube braze.
