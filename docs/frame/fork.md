# Forks

## 2005–2008 “63 mm” Model
- Narrow 63 mm rear spacing—most aftermarket 26" fat‐bike hubs use 100 mm/135 mm spacing, so builds are rare.  
- Front forks: original Surly Pug forks were 100 mm spacing with an offset to clear 3.8" tires.  

## 2009–2017 “100 / 135” Model
- Forks changed to standard 100 mm front spacing; many aftermarket forks fit straight in.  
- Look for 100 mm Pugsley forks from Surly or aftermarket (e.g., Salsa Beargrease).  

## Headset Interactions
- Lightweight forks often require a zero-stack headset, whereas steel Surly forks use a 1 1⁄8” straight steerer.
