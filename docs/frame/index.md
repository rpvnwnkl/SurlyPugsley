# Frame, Fork, and Headset

If you're reading this, you've already climbed part of the fat‑bike mountain. The Surly Pugsley isn't the highest peak, but it's definitely on the mountain, and that's where the fun starts. More than just a frameset, the Pugsley is a cultural icon because of its oddball offset design. Its 17.5 mm drive‑side offset and 135 mm rear hub spacing let fat tyres clear the chain with a standard 100 mm bottom bracket and make it possible to swap front and rear wheels when you're far from home. That quirk unlocked fat‑biking for riders using the parts they already had, and it still gives you options today. Depending on your drivetrain and rim, the rear end can squeeze anything from the stock 4.3 inch rubber up to about a 4.8 inch tyre with appropriate gearing ([Surly Pugsley 2.0 returns as a complete touring fat bike with bigger tires - Bikerumor](https://bikerumor.com/surly-pugsley-2-0-returns-complete-touring-fat-bike-bigger-tires/#:~:text=New%20to%20the%20frame%20though,that%20the%20option%20is%20there)). The matching fork uses the same 135 mm hub and is rated for about a 4.3 inch front tyre, but you can also mount a rear wheel up front if you need a spare freehub or brake. The frame and fork bristle with braze‑ons for racks, bottle cages and fenders, and the head tube uses a standard 1 ⅛ inch threadless headset. It's an invitation to adventure—try it on a Pugsley or let it inspire your own fat‑bike build.
