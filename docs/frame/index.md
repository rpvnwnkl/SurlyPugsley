# Frame, Fork, and Headset  
The Surly Pugsley frameset combines a stout 4130 CroMoly steel frame with a matching offset fork to create a bike that's ready for snow, sand or singletrack.  It uses 135 mm–spaced horizontal rear‑loading dropouts that are offset 17.5 mm to the drive side so a fat tire (up to 3.8″ wide on an 82‑84 mm rim) can clear the chain when used with a 100 mm bottom bracket.  The matching fork also takes a 135 mm rear hub and can handle a 4.8″ front tire, making it possible to swap front and rear wheels if you need a backup brake or freehub out on the trail.  Both frame and fork are covered with braze‑ons for racks, bottle cages and fenders, and the head tube accepts a standard 1 1/8″ threadless headset.
