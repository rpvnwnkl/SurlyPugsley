# Frame, Fork, and Headset  
The Pugsley was one of the first commercially available fat bike framesets, and its off set design remains its standout feature. Using 135 mm rear spacing with a 17.5 mm drive‑side offset, the frame lets fat tyres clear the chain and allows you to swap front and rear wheels. With the right rim and drivetrain setup, a Pugsley will run tyres up to about 4.8 inches wide and accepts 26″, 27.5″ (650 b) and 29″/700 c wheelsets. Both frame and fork come with braze‑ons for racks, bottle cages and fenders. For detailed geometry and specifications, see the official Pugsley frame sheet.
