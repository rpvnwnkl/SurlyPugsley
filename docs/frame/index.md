# Frame, Fork, and Headset  
The Surly Pugsley frameset combines a stout 4130 CroMoly steel frame with a matching offset fork to create a bike that's ready for snow, sand or singletrack.  It uses 135 mm–spaced horizontal rear‑loading dropouts that are offset 17.5 mm to the drive side so fat tyres clear the chain when used with a 100 mm bottom bracket.  Depending on your drivetrain and rim choice, the rear end can accommodate tyres from the stock 4.3″ up to around 4.8″ wide; the matching fork also takes a 135 mm rear hub and is rated for about a 4.3″ front tyre, making it possible to swap front and rear wheels if you need a backup brake or freehub out on the trail.  Both frame and fork are covered with braze‑ons for racks, bottle cages and fenders, and the head tube accepts a standard 1 1/8″ threadless headset.
