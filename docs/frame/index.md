# Frame, Fork, and Headset

The Pugsley was one of the first commercially available fat‑bike framesets, and its off‑set design remains its standout feature. The frame uses 135 mm rear spacing with a 17.5 mm drive‑side offset, letting fat tyres clear the chain with a standard 100 mm bottom bracket and allowing you to swap front and rear wheels. That quirk made it easy to build fat bikes using existing parts and still provides flexibility today. Depending on rim width and drivetrain, the rear end can run anything from the stock 4.3 inch tyre up to about a 4.8 inch tyre. The matching fork uses the same 135 mm hub and is rated for a 4.3 inch front tyre, but you can fit a rear wheel up front if you need a spare hub or brake. Both frame and fork have braze‑ons for racks, bottle cages and fenders, and the head tube takes a standard 1 1/8 inch threadless headset.
