# Upgrades

- **Cranksets**:  
  - Stock Surly 100 mm BB with 33 mm spindle → switch to a SRAM DUB 83 mm for lower Q‐factor.  
  - Consider 30 t vs. 28 t rings (3 mm offset differences—affects chainline).  

- **Drivetrain Tweak**:  
  - Replace stock derailleur hanger with a replaceable hanger (e.g. Wheels Manufacturing)  
  - Upgrade to 12-speed drivetrain for wider range.  

- **Handlebars & Stem**:  
  - Surly Moloko bars + V-bar for better leverage when lugging through snow.  
  - Shorten stem to improve steering quickness on loose terrain.
