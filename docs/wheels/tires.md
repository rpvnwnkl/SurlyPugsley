# Tires

- **Recommended Width**: 3.8”–4.8” (depending on rim width).  
- **Popular Models**:  
  - Surly Bud and Lou (3.8”)  
  - Vee Tire Snow Shoe (4.0”)  
  - 45NRTH Dillinger 5 (5.0”)—fits on 90 mm rims if you’re swapping to Rabbit Hole.  
- **Tubeless vs. Tubed**:  
  - Tubeless (Stan’s Flow CB7 + Dillinger 4) gives lower pressures and fewer flats.  
  - Many older Pugsleys ran tubes, which can pinch flat if you drop below 8 PSI.
