# Wheels  

Prior to fatbikes it was unusual for a recreational bicycle to need multiple wheelsets, let alone wheelsets of different diameters. When the rubber hits the road, the interaction between bike and ground happens through the tyres and wheels. That sense of gliding over the terrain — almost flying — is one of the magic parts of cycling. On a rigid bike, the quality of that flight is dictated by the width and diameter of your tyres: some tyres are fast on firm surfaces, others climb mountains and float over sand or snow.  

Because fat bikes are designed around very wide tyres, they can typically accommodate wheelsets of almost any width and in diameters from 26 in to 29 in. The Pugsley is no exception. Its use of the popular 135 mm hub spacing meant that riders quickly experimented with alternative wheelsets to tune handling and speed. Over time, multiple wheelsets became a common accessory for many Pugsley owners.
