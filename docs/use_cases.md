# Use Case Breakdown

The Pugsley excels in environments that defeat conventional MTBs:

1. **Snow & Winter**  
   - Floatation on 3.7–4.3″ tires; ideal for Arrowhead 135, Iditarod Trail Invitational  
   - Studded tires (e.g. 45NRTH Dillinger) for ice  

2. **Sand & Beach**  
   - Loose beach sand, desert washes → 3.8–4.3″ tires at low PSI  
   - Front/tip tire swaps (4.8″ Bud/Lou up front on Moonlander fork)  

3. **Expedition/Touring**  
   - Global 26″ parts availability; Braze-ons for racks, cages  
   - Documented trips: Andes, Mongolia, Antarctica (e.g. Joe Cruz’s tours)  

4. **Trail Riding**  
   - Passive suspension from big tires; occasional 29″ conversion for speed  
   - Fun traction on roots/rocks but heavy for tight singletrack  

5. **Utility & Cargo**  
   - Hauling gear, groceries, firewood in winter; BOB trailers on snow  
   - Bike‐tram “snow tractor” setups
