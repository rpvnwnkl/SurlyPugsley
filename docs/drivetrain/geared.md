# Geared Drivetrain

## 1×12 Setups
- **SRAM GX 12-speed** + **NX 12-speed cassette**: requires 135 mm freehub, 10 mm–11 speed chain.  
- **Shimano XT M8100** 12-speed: works with HG freehub, 2.4 mm chain link.  
- **Chainline**: Aim for ~52 mm chainline with 42 mm Q-factor cranks (e.g., SRAM GX fat cranks).  
- **Front Derailleurs** (if doing 2×): Limited clearance due to chainstay curve; consider E2-style clamp or mid-mount adapter.

## 2×10 or 2×11 (rare)
- Less common—often requires extreme chainstay clearance checks.  
- We recommend sticking to 1× setups for maximum tire clearance.
