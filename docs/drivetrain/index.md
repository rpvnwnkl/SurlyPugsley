# Drivetrain Setups & Evolution

Surly designed the Pugsley to run **standard MTB drivetrains**—just widened—while allowing creative single‐speed or IGH setups.

- **2005–2010**  
  - 3 × 8/9 triple (max 44 T big ring) + 11–32T cassette  
  - E-type BB front derailleur mount for chain-ring clearance  
  - Horizontal dropouts → easy single-speed conversion, front/rear wheel swap in emergencies  

- **2011–2014**  
  - 2 × 10 “Ops” editions with MWOD cranks (22/36 T), 10-speed cassettes (11–36 T)  
  - Wide Q-factor accepted as trade-off for durability  

- **2018 1×11**  
  - Race Face 30 T chainring + 11–46 T freewheel; no front mech  
  - Thread-on freewheel rear hub & identical front hub for on-trail cog swap  
  - IGH (Rohloff, Alfine) or belt-drive conversions common  

- **Community Mods**  
  - Single-speed builds for reliability in sand/snow  
  - Internal-gear hub touring rigs  
  - 29+ and tubeless conversions
