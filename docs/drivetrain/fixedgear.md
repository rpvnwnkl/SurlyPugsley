# Fixed-Gear (FG)

- **Phil Wood Fixed Hub**: Drop-in track hub—requires flipping chainline to ~53 mm.  
- **Freewheel vs. Track Cog**:  
  - Track cog → fixed (flip-flop hub if available)  
  - Freewheel (easier to coast) but risk of cross-threading on fat-bike shell.  

## Safety Note
- No coaster brakes on fat bikes—front brake mandatory. Always run a front disc brake if you’re doing FG.
