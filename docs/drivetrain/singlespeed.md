- **Horizontal Dropouts**: Many Pugsley frames have sliding dropouts—perfect for tensioning a chain without an eccentric.  
- **Chain Tensioners**: If your dropouts are vertical, use a Surly Jiggle Go or Wolf Tooth Tanpan.  
- **Gear Ratios**:  
  - Fat-bike recommended ratios: 28×32, 30×32, or 32×36 (depending on terrain).  
  - Lower ratio for steeper climbs in snow/sand.
