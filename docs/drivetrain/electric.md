# Electric-Assist

- **Mid-Drive Kits**:  
  - Bafang BBSHD/BBS02: Requires dropouts to be heat-treated; chainstay will need clearance.  
  - TQ HPR50: High-torque, long battery life, but expensive.  

- **Hub-Drive Kits**:  
  - Front Hub Motor (100 mm spacing): easiest, keeps rear end stock.  
  - Rear Hub Motor (135 mm spacing): easy, but adds unsprung weight; use a 26″ fat-bike rim.  
  - Battery Placement: Use a frame-bag or rear rack mount to keep the center of gravity low.  

## Battery Options
- 48 V 14 Ah (long range, heavy)  
- 36 V 10 Ah (lighter, shorter range)  

_Tip: Many people run mid-drive with a 1×11 or 1×12 to balance motor torque and gear range._
