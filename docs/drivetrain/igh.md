# Internal Gear Hub (IGH)

- **Rohloff Speedhub 14**: 135 mm dropout—ideal for Pugsley. Chainline ~42 mm.  
- **Shimano Alfine 11**: cheaper, 135 mm, chainsuck can be an issue—use a high-quality chain guide.  
- **NuVinci N330/N380**: Continuously variable, but heavy. Use fender-compatible tires to keep weight down.  

## Shifter & Cable Routing
- Surly Pugsley frames usually have ample braze-ons for long-pull shifters.  
- Keep housing runs as straight as possible to reduce friction.
