# History of the Surly Pugsley

The Surly Pugsley was the first mass-produced fat-bike, debuting in 2005 as a “snow bike” prototype at Interbike. By mid-2005 Surly offered both frameset (4130 CroMoly steel, 135 × 100 mm offset) and complete builds that could run 26 × 3.7″ tires on 65 mm rims, pioneering terrain where standard MTBs sank in snow, sand, or mud.

- **2005–2010**: Early adopters ran 3×8 or 3×9 gearing, interchangeable front/rear wheels (135 mm QR offset), and Surly’s Endomorph 3.7″ tire for snow and sand floatation.
- **2011–2013**: “Necromancer”/Black Ops edition introduced 82 mm Rolling Darryl rims and MWOD cranks to clear bigger tires.
- **2014–2017**: Pugsley remained largely unchanged as Surly expanded its fat-bike lineup (Moonlander, Ice Cream Truck), drifting toward a niche expedition role.
- **2018 Reissue (“Pugsley 2.0”)**: Updated for expedition use—26 × 4.3″ ready, 1×11 drivetrain, slacker head­tube (~69.5°), longer wheelbase, Gnot‐Boost 145 × 12 mm dropouts for thru-axle + Rohloff compatibility.
- **2020 Discontinuation**: Surly retired the Pugsley (along with Troll, LHT) after a 15-year run, cementing its legend in “fat‐bike history.”
