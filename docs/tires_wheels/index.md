# Tires, Wheels & Hub Standards

Surly Pugsley’s hardware is all about floatation, strength, and field-serviceability.

## Tires
- **Endomorph 26×3.7″** (intro tire), Larry 3.8″, Nate 3.8″ (knobby)  
- **Edna 26×4.3″** (2018 reissue) — sweet spot for float vs. weight  
- Studded options: 45NRTH Dillinger, Vee Snowshoe  
- Summer mods: 29 × 2.3/3.0 for mixed terrain (“Krampug”)

## Rims
- **Large Marge 65 mm** (offset drilled) → Rolling Darryl 82 mm → MOBD 80 mm tubeless  
- Offset drilling reduces dish for 135 mm hubs  
- Today: tubeless ready rims (Surly MOBD, Velocity Dually) for low‐psi float

## Hubs & Spacing
- **135 × 10 QR** front + rear (identical wheels can swap in the field)  
- **2018 Gnot-Boost**: 145 × 12 mm dropouts, supports 135 QR, 142 × 12 mm thru-axle, Rohloff  
- Thread-on freewheel rear hub on 2018 model for ultimate redundancy

### Community Wheel Builds
- Offset 29er/27.5+ conversions for summer use  
- Tubeless setups: gorilla-tape hacks → modern tubeless rims  
- Common Q&A: “Can I use a centered rim and dish 17.5 mm?” → Yes, if you cut spoke lengths accordingly.
