The Surly Pugsley, introduced in 2005, was the world’s first mass-produced **fat bike**, built for ultra-wide tires that float over soft terrain. Its origins lie in extreme Alaskan endurance races like the [Iditarod Trail Invitational](https://iditarod.com/trail-invitational/), where riders literally welded rims together and stitched tires to conquer deep snow. Surly commercialized those garage-lab innovations with the 3.7″ [Endomorph tire](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/pugsley/) and 65 mm [Large Marge rim](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/pugsley/), transforming a niche experiment into a practical snow-and-sand machine you could buy at your local shop.

To overcome the lack of fat-bike-specific parts, Surly engineered a 17.5 mm frame offset to clear a 26 × 3.8″ tire on a standard 135 mm hub, and borrowed a 100 mm bottom-bracket shell (from downhill bikes) so a regular crankset would fit. Even the front and rear wheels were interchangeable—a clever fail-safe on remote expeditions. Designed to go “where there is no road or trail” (see [Surly Bikes blog](https://surlybikes.com/blog/haulin_some_history)), the Pugsley unlocked snow, sand, bogs, beaches, and beyond. Its go-anywhere ethos and simple, robust design sparked the modern fat-bike movement—every Beargrease, Fatboy, and Mukluk today owes a debt to this trailblazing classic.
