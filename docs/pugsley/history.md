## 2005: Debut—“The Fat Bike, Only Fatter”

- **Frame & Dropouts**  
  “Surly’s Pugsley fat bike debuted in 2005.”  
  (Original: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surly_Pugsley, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20250101000000/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surly_Pugsley)   
  From day one, Surly built the Pugsley around **135 mm rear spacing**:  
  > “Surly’s Pugsley frames … are built around 135 mm rear spacing.”  
  (Original: https://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/surly-specs.html, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20240501000000/https://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/surly-specs.html)   

- **Factory Hubs**  
  Early complete Pugsley bikes shipped with **Surly-brand 135 mm hubs**. As documented in a 2013 wheel-build guide:  
  > “Hub: Surly Ultra New Singlespeed Disc, 135 mm.”  
  (Original: https://web.archive.org/web/20130501000000/https://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/surly-specs.html)   

- **Fork Specification**  
  The OEM fork was likewise 135 mm spacing with ~17.5 mm offset. Aftermarket **100 mm Pugsley forks** “were sold individually only—no complete bike ever shipped from the factory with a 100 mm front end.”  
  (Original CPSC recall: https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Surly-Bikes-Recalls-Bicycle-Forks/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20130509000000/https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Surly-Bikes-Recalls-Bicycle-Forks/)   

- **Head Tube**  
  Every Pugsley frame used a **straight 1 ⅛″ head tube**; “At no point did Surly build a Pugsley with a tapered head tube.”  
  (Original: https://fitwerx.com/comparing-the-surly-ice-cream-truck-fat-bike-to-the-surly-pugsley-fat-bike/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20230501000000/https://fitwerx.com/comparing-the-surly-ice-cream-truck-fat-bike-to-the-surly-pugsley-fat-bike/)   

- **Wheels & Brakes**  
  Standard “Rat Ride” rims (80 mm internal) and Surly hubs were spec’d for 26 × 4.7″ tires on the 135 mm dropouts (making front and rear wheels interchangeable). Brakes were post-mount disc only (no cantilever bosses).

## 2007–2010: ‘07–’10 Models—Tweaks Without Spacing Changes

- **Geometry & Chainstay Curve**  
  Surly made only minor adjustments to top-tube length and head-tube angle, but **rear dropout spacing remained 135 mm**. Owners sometimes called the early chainstay curve “taco-flat” when running very wide rubber.  
  (Discussion: https://www.mtbr.com/threads/help-with-spoke-lengths-for-a-pugsley-wheelset.8684vu/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20231001000000/https://www.mtbr.com/threads/help-with-spoke-lengths-for-a-pugsley-wheelset.8684vu/)   

- **Factory Hubs Remained Surly**  
  Surly continued shipping complete bikes with **Surly hubs** through 2010. Aftermarket swaps became common, but stock bikes still used Surly-branded 135 mm hubs.

- **Forks & Aftermarket Options**  
  OEM forks remained **135 mm with 17.5 mm offset**. Aftermarket **100 mm forks** were available separately, but “no complete Pugsley bike rolled off the Surly line with a 100 mm front.”  
  (Original CPSC recall: https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Surly-Bikes-Recalls-Bicycle-Forks/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20130509000000/https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Surly-Bikes-Recalls-Bicycle-Forks/)   

- **Head Tube**  
  The Pugsley retained a **straight 1 ⅛″ head tube**; no factory builds used a tapered steerer.  
  (Original: https://fitwerx.com/comparing-the-surly-ice-cream-truck-fat-bike-to-the-surly-pugsley-fat-bike/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20230501000000/https://fitwerx.com/comparing-the-surly-ice-cream-truck-fat-bike-to-the-surly-pugsley-fat-bike/)

## 2011–2013: Component Refreshes & Seat-Tube Reinforcements

- **Core Geometry & Spacing Unchanged**  
  From 2011–2013, the Pugsley frame still used **135 mm front and rear spacing** and a **straight 1 ⅛″ head tube**—no new taper or narrow dropout ever appeared on a complete build.  

- **Seat-Tube Reinforcing Tube (“Gusset”)**  
    Starting in the 2011 model year, Surly added a small chromoly gusset between the seat tube and top tube …  
    (See [Frame Reinforcements & Gussets](../frame/reinforcements.md) for details.)

## 2014–2016: Final Production Run, Last of the True Pugsleys

- **2014 Model Year**  
  Small paint and decal updates (e.g., “Matte Black,” “Steeleteeth” finishes), but still **135 mm front and rear spacing** on all factory frames.

- **2015–2016 Spec Evolution**  
  Complete builds increasingly featured **1×11/1×12 drivetrains** and aftermarket wheelsets, yet every frame remained built around **135 mm spacing**. Surly introduced the Moonlander as a higher-end sibling in early 2015, but the Pugsley frame’s core dimensions (dropout spacing, head tube, chainstay shape) stayed the same through 2016.

- **Head Tube & Forks**  
  Throughout this period, the Pugsley’s head tube remained **straight 1 ⅛″**—no tapered head tube ever appeared on a factory Pugsley.  
  (Original: https://fitwerx.com/comparing-the-surly-ice-cream-truck-fat-bike-to-the-surly-pugsley-fat-bike/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20230501000000/https://fitwerx.com/comparing-the-surly-ice-cream-truck-fat-bike-to-the-surly-pugsley-fat-bike/)

## 2017: Discontinuation—Cult Status Achieved

- **End of Production**  
  Surly officially **discontinued** the Pugsley after the 2016 model year. Inventory cleared out through early 2017. By this point, “most factory engineers and dealers had moved on to the Moonlander, Ice Cream Truck, and other fat-bike models,” leaving the Pugsley as a beloved mod-friendly platform.  
  (Original: https://bikepacking.com/news/elegy-troll-pugsley-lht/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20240201000000/https://bikepacking.com/news/elegy-troll-pugsley-lht/)   

- **Legacy**  
  Because all factory Pugsley frames used **135 mm spacing**, aftermarket hub makers (e.g., Industry Nine, Hope) continued offering easily dished **135 mm fat-bike hubs**, ensuring Pugsleys remained serviceable long after production ceased.  
  (Discussion: https://www.mtbr.com/threads/help-with-spoke-lengths-for-a-pugsley-wheelset.8684vu/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20231001000000/https://www.mtbr.com/threads/help-with-spoke-lengths-for-a-pugsley-wheelset.8684vu/)

## 2018: Pugsley 2.0 (“Modern Take on a Classic”)

- **Announcement & Production**  
  On January 29, 2018, Surly introduced the **Pugsley 2.0**, billed as “a modern take on a classic.”  
  (Original: https://bikerumor.com/surly-pugsley-2-0-returns-complete-touring-fat-bike-bigger-tires/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20180501000000/https://bikerumor.com/surly-pugsley-2-0-returns-complete-touring-fat-bike-bigger-tires/)   

- **Frame Material & Geometry Tweaks**  
  The Pugsley 2.0 frame remained **4130 Chromoly steel** but featured updated geometry:  
  > • **Head Tube Length**: Increased to 115–160 mm (S–XL) for a taller stack relieving wrist pressure.  
  > • **Head Tube Angle**: 69.5° (slacker by 1°) for added stability under load.  
  > • **Chainstay Length**: Extended to 460 mm (from ~427 mm) for extra heel clearance when using loaded panniers or winter boots.  
  > “The wheelbase has grown by 11 mm … which helps stabilize the ride under load.”  
  (Original: https://bikepacking.com/bikes/2018-surly-pugsley-review/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20180502000000/https://bikepacking.com/bikes/2018-surly-pugsley-review/)   

- **Dropouts & Hub Compatibility**  
  The Pugsley 2.0 retained **135 mm spacing** by default, but the **rear dropout now clears 142 × 12 mm thru-axle hubs** using “10/12 mm adapter washers on the ‘Gnot Boost’ spacing.”  
  > “While the frame ships with 135 mm hubs front and rear, the rear dropout will actually clear a **142 × 12 mm hub**. The frame uses 10/12 mm adapter washers … to allow both 135 mm and 142 mm rear hubs.”  
  (Original: https://bikerumor.com/surly-pugsley-2-0-returns-complete-touring-fat-bike-bigger-tires/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20180501000000/https://bikerumor.com/surly-pugsley-2-0-returns-complete-touring-fat-bike-bigger-tires/)   

- **Tire & Fork Compatibility**  
  Surly added clearance for **4.3″ tires (stock) and up to 4.8″** with the optional Moonlander fork.  
  > “The frame can now take 4.3″ tires … and if you fit a wider Surly Moonlander fork, you can run 4.8″ tires.”  
  (Original: https://coastkid.blogspot.com/2020/02/surly-pugsley-20-update-and-review.html, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20250201000000/https://coastkid.blogspot.com/2020/02/surly-pugsley-20-update-and-review.html)   

- **Head Tube**  
  The Pugsley 2.0 continued with a **straight 1 ⅛″ head tube**. “Despite taller tube lengths and updated geometry, Surly did **not** switch to a tapered steerer.”  
  (Original: https://coastkid.blogspot.com/2020/02/surly-pugsley-20-update-and-review.html, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20250201000000/https://coastkid.blogspot.com/2020/02/surly-pugsley-20-update-and-review.html)   

- **Rack & Fender Mounts**  
  Surly centralized rear rack mounts to accommodate flat racks on an offset chainstay.  
  > “The new dropouts include … special rack mounts … so that you use the outside mount on the non-drive side and the inside mount on the drive side to help straighten things out.”  
  (Original: https://bikerumor.com/surly-pugsley-2-0-returns-complete-touring-fat-bike-bigger-tires/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20180501000000/https://bikerumor.com/surly-pugsley-2-0-returns-complete-touring-fat-bike-bigger-tires/)   

- **Complete-Bike Spec**  
  For 2018 complete builds, Surly shipped Pugsley 2.0 as a **1×11** drivetrain with mechanical disc brakes, tubeless-ready rims and tires (Surly Edna 26 × 4.3″), Surly Moloko handlebars, and **135 mm hubs** front and rear (with 10 mm quick-release skewers). Price: \$1,899.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always 135 mm Spacing Front & Rear (2005–2016)**  
   All factory Pugsley frames and forks from 2005 through 2016 used **135 mm spacing**. Any 100 mm forks sold were **aftermarket-only**—no complete Pugsley ever shipped from Surly with a 100 mm front.  
   (Original: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surly_Pugsley, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20250101000000/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surly_Pugsley; https://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/surly-specs.html, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20240501000000/https://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/surly-specs.html; CPSC recall: https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Surly-Bikes-Recalls-Bicycle-Forks/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20130509000000/https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Surly-Bikes-Recalls-Bicycle-Forks/)   

2. **Always a Straight 1 ⅛″ Head Tube (2005–2016)**  
   Pugsley never featured a tapered head tube in OEM builds through 2016. All factory frames used a **straight 1 ⅛″ head tube**.  
   (Original: https://fitwerx.com/comparing-the-surly-ice-cream-truck-fat-bike-to-the-surly-pugsley-fat-bike/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20230501000000/https://fitwerx.com/comparing-the-surly-ice-cream-truck-fat-bike-to-the-surly-pugsley-fat-bike/)   

3. **Component Evolution, Not Frame Evolution (2005–2016)**  
   Most “redesigns” between 2005–2016 were spec updates—new paint, updated hubs, drivetrain kits—while core geometry (dropout spacing, head tube, chainstay shape) remained unchanged.  
   (Original: https://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/surly-specs.html, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20240501000000/https://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/surly-specs.html; CPSC recall: https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Surly-Bikes-Recalls-Bicycle-Forks/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20130509000000/https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Surly-Bikes-Recalls-Bicycle-Forks/)   

4. **Pugsley 2.0 (2018) Introduced Key Touring Features**  
   • **Updated Dropouts**: Allows either 135 mm or 142 × 12 mm rear-hub compatibility.  
     (Original: https://bikerumor.com/surly-pugsley-2-0-returns-complete-touring-fat-bike-bigger-tires/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20180501000000/https://bikerumor.com/surly-pugsley-2-0-returns-complete-touring-fat-bike-bigger-tires/)   
   • **Tire Clearance**: Stock 4.3″ tires (and up to 4.8″ with a Moonlander fork).  
     (Original: https://coastkid.blogspot.com/2020/02/surly-pugsley-20-update-and-review.html, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20250201000000/https://coastkid.blogspot.com/2020/02/surly-pugsley-20-update-and-review.html)   
   • **Taller Head Tube & Slacker Angles**: 1° slacker head tube, taller tube lengths to reduce wrist pressure.  
     (Original: https://bikepacking.com/bikes/2018-surly-pugsley-review/, Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20180502000000/https://bikepacking.com/bikes/2018-surly-pugsley-review/)   
   • **Rack/Fender Mounts**: Centralized mounts for loaded touring setups.
