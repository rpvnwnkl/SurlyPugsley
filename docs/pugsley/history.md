## 2005: Debut—“The Fat Bike, Only Fatter”

- **Introduction & Spacing**  
  “Surly’s Pugsley fat bike debuted in 2005” .  
  From the very first production frames, Surly built the Pugsley around **135 mm rear spacing**:  
  > “Surly’s Pugsley frames have a head tube designed to accommodate a fork with a standard 1 1/8″ steerer tube, and are built around 135 mm rear spacing.”   

- **Fork Specification**  
  The factory-spec fork was also built to **135 mm spacing** with ~17.5 mm offset. Aftermarket **100 mm Pugsley forks** existed but “were sold individually only—no complete bike ever shipped from the factory with a 100 mm front end.”   

- **Head Tube**  
  Every Pugsley frame used a **straight 1 1/8″ head tube**; “At no point did Surly build a Pugsley with a tapered head tube.”   

- **Wheels & Brakes**  
  Standard “Rat Ride” rims (80 mm internal) and Surly hubs were spec’d for 26 × 4.7″ or similar tires, all on 135 mm dropout spacing, meaning front and rear wheels were interchangeable. Post-mount disc was the only brake option (no cantilever bosses).

## 2007–2010: ‘07–’10 Models—Tweaks Without Spacing Changes

- **Geometry & Chainstay**  
  Minor adjustments to top-tube length and head tube angle occurred through these years, but **rear dropout spacing remained 135 mm**. Owners sometimes referred to the early chainstay curve as “taco-flat” when running very wide tires.   

- **Forks & Aftermarket Options**  
  Surly continued producing the **135 mm fork** for complete builds; aftermarket **100 mm Pugsley forks** were offered “as separate items only.”   

- **Head Tube**  
  Still a **straight 1 1/8″ head tube**—no factory-shipped tapered steerer.

## 2011–2013: Component Refreshes, Same Core Frame

- **Component Spec Updates**  
  By 2011, Surly had largely phased out in-house hubs in favor of aftermarket options (Hadley, Phil Wood, etc.), but the frame still rode on **135 mm spacing** front and rear. Drivetrain spec began shifting toward 1×10/1×11 as those groupsets matured, yet remained fully compatible with the existing 135 mm hubs.  

- **Fork & Head Tube**  
  OEM forks remained **135 mm with straight 1 1/8″ steerer**. “Surly Pugsley 100 mm bicycle forks were sold individually only… Surly Pugsley 135 mm bicycle forks were sold individually and as part of 2013 model year complete bicycles.”   

- **Frame Updates**  
  Minor reinforcement gussets around the head tube and seat tube junction appeared, but **geometry and spacing were unchanged** from earlier years.

## 2014–2016: Final Production Run—Last of the True Pugsleys

- **2014 Model Year**  
  Small paint and decal changes (e.g., Matte Black, Steeleteeth finishes), but still **135 mm front and rear spacing** on all factory frames.  

- **2015–2016 Spec Evolutions**  
  Spec kits continued evolving—1×11 and 1×12 drivetrains became common—but frames remained **built around 135 mm spacing**. Surly introduced the Moonlander as a higher-end sibling in 2015, yet the Pugsley frame’s core dimensions (including dropouts and head tube) stayed the same.  

- **Head Tube & Forks**  
  Throughout this period, the Pugsley’s head tube remained **straight 1 1/8″**; no tapered head tube appeared on any factory Pugsley. “The Surly Pugsley has a head tube designed to accommodate a fork with a standard 1 1/8″ steerer tube.”

## 2017: Discontinuation—Cult Status Achieved

- **End of Production**  
  Surly officially discontinued the Pugsley after the 2016 model year; inventory cleared out through early 2017. By this point, “most factory engineers and dealers had moved on to the Moonlander, Ice Cream Truck, and other fat-bike models,” leaving the Pugsley as a beloved platform for aftermarket modifications.  

- **Legacy**  
  Because every factory Pugsley used **135 mm spacing** front and rear, aftermarket hub makers like Industry Nine and Hope provided easily dished 135 mm fat hubs, keeping Pugsleys rolling long after production ended.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always 135 mm Spacing Front & Rear**  
   From 2005–2016, every factory Pugsley frame and fork shipped with **135 mm spacing**, both front and rear. Any 100 mm Pugsley forks on the market were **aftermarket-only**—no complete Pugsley ever left Surly with a 100 mm front.   

2. **Always a Straight 1 1/8″ Head Tube**  
   Pugsley never featured a tapered head tube in OEM builds. All factory frames used a **straight 1 1/8″ head tube** throughout its production run.   

3. **Chainstay Curve (“Taco-Flat”)**  
   Early Pugsleys (2005–2010) had a pronounced chainstay curve for tire clearance—owners dubbed it “taco-flat” when very wide rubber nearly touched the chainstay. This characteristic chainstay design stayed consistent through 2016.   

4. **Component Evolution, Not Frame Evolution**  
   Most perceived “redesigns” were spec updates—new hubs, new drivetrains, fresh paint—not fundamental frame changes. Core geometry (dropout spacing, head tube, chainstay design) was essentially unchanged from introduction to discontinuation.
