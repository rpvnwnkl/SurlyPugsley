# Pugsley-Specific Quirks

- **Offset Fork Spacing**: The original Pugsley forks used 100 mm spacing with a 10 mm tire offset, requiring special hub dishing or Surly Moonlander forks (100 mm front, 135 mm rear).  
- **135 mm Rear Hub**: Many aftermarket hubs need careful dishing to fit properly.  
- **Chainstay Curve**: Unique curve for clearance—limits certain derailleur wrap options.  
- **Triple vs. Double vs. Single**: Frame designed with triple‐to‐single conversion in mind, but front derailleur mounting can be quirky.  
- **Steel vs. Aluminum vs. Titanium**: Frame material changes year-to-year; ride feel differs.  

> _Pro tip: keep track of your original dropout spacing and rim offset if you’re mixing/matching hubs in a 135 mm shell._
