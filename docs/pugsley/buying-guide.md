# Buying Guide

## 1. New vs. Used
- **New**: Hard to find—Surly discontinued this model in 2017. Check dealers who still have stock or special re-releases.  
- **Used**: Craigslist, Pinkbike, local Facebook groups. Inspect for rust, frame alignment, and wear on threads.  

## 2. Model Year Differences
- **Original 2005–2008**: 63mm rear hub. Beware of scarcity of 63mm hubs.  
- **2009–2010**: Switched to 100 mm front, 135 mm rear. Common aftermarket hubs fit easily.  
- **2011–2017**: Tapered headtube, updated fork rake. Check for tapered vs. straight headtube.  

## 3. What to Check
- Frame alignment & any knocks (dropout alignment, chainstay curve).  
- Fork spacing (some earlier forks are 100 mm but require an offset).  
- Headset style (straight 1 1⁄8 vs. tapered 1 1⁄8–1 1⁄2).  
- Brake mounts: Post-mount versus IS.  

## 4. Price Ranges (as of 2025)
- **Original 63mm framesets**: \$600–\$800 (used).  
- **2011+ 135 mm framesets**: \$800–\$1,000 (used).  
- **Complete builds**: \$1,200–\$1,800 (depending on parts).
