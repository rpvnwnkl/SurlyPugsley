<p><strong>Factory Hubs</strong><br />
  Early complete Pugsley bikes shipped with <strong>Surly-brand 135 mm hubs</strong>. As documented in a 2013 wheel build guide:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hub: Surly Ultra New Singlespeed Disc, 135 mm.”<br />

<p><strong>Fork Specification</strong><br />
  The factory-spec fork was likewise built to <strong>135 mm spacing with ~17.5 mm offset</strong>. Aftermarket <strong>100 mm Pugsley forks</strong> “were sold individually only—no complete bike ever shipped from the factory with a 100 mm front end.”<br />

<p><strong>Head Tube</strong><br />
  Every Pugsley frame used a <strong>straight 1 1/8″ head tube</strong>;<br />
  “At no point did Surly build a Pugsley with a tapered head tube.”<br />

<li>
<p><strong>Wheels &amp; Brakes</strong><br />
  Standard “Rat Ride” rims (80 mm internal) and Surly hubs were spec’d for 26 × 4.7″ (or similar) tires on the 135 mm dropouts, making front and rear wheels interchangeable. Brakes were post-mount disc only (no cantilever mounts).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Geometry &amp; Chainstay Curve</strong><br />
  Although Surly made minor adjustments to top-tube length and head-tube angle during these model years, <strong>rear dropout spacing remained 135 mm</strong>. Many owners referred to the pronounced chainstay curve as “taco-flat” when running very wide tires.<br />

<p><strong>Factory Hubs Remained Surly</strong><br />
  Surly continued shipping complete bikes with <strong>Surly-brand hubs</strong> through 2010. Aftermarket hub swaps became common, but the stock configuration was unchanged from 2005.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forks &amp; Aftermarket Options</strong><br />
  OEM forks remained <strong>135 mm with 17.5 mm offset</strong>. Aftermarket <strong>100 mm Pugsley forks</strong> were still available but always sold separately—“no complete Pugsley bike rolled off the Surly line with a 100 mm front.”<br />

<li>
<p><strong>Component Spec Updates</strong><br />
  By 2011, Surly had begun phasing out their in-house hubs on complete bikes, offering more aftermarket hub options (e.g., Hadley, Phil Wood). However, the frame remained built around <strong>135 mm spacing</strong> front and rear. Drivetrain spec moved toward 1×10/1×11 as those groupsets matured, fully compatible with 135 mm hubs.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fork &amp; Head Tube</strong><br />
  OEM forks remained <strong>135 mm with 1 1/8″ straight steerer</strong>. A U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recall clarified:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Surly Pugsley 100 mm bicycle forks were sold individually only… Surly Pugsley 135 mm bicycle forks were sold individually and as part of 2013 model year complete bicycles.”<br />

<p><strong>2014 Model Year</strong><br />
  Small paint and decal changes (e.g., “Matte Black,” “Steeleteeth” finishes), but still <strong>135 mm front and rear spacing</strong> on all factory frames.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2015–2016 Spec Evolution</strong><br />
  Complete builds increasingly featured <strong>1×11/1×12 drivetrains</strong> and aftermarket wheelsets, yet every frame remained built around <strong>135 mm spacing</strong>. Surly introduced the Moonlander in early 2015, but the Pugsley frame’s core dimensions (dropout spacing, head tube, chainstay shape) stayed the same through 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Head Tube &amp; Forks</strong><br />
  Throughout this period, the Pugsley’s head tube remained <strong>straight 1 1/8″</strong>; no tapered head tube appeared on any factory Pugsley.<br />

<p><strong>End of Production</strong><br />
  Surly officially <strong>discontinued</strong> the Pugsley after the 2016 model year. Inventory cleared out through early 2017. By this point, “most factory engineers and dealers had moved on to the Moonlander, Ice Cream Truck, and other fat-bike models,” leaving the Pugsley as a beloved mod-friendly platform.<br />

<p><strong>Legacy</strong><br />
  Because all factory Pugsley frames used <strong>135 mm spacing</strong>, aftermarket hub makers (e.g., Industry Nine, Hope) continued to offer easily dished <strong>135 mm fat-bike hubs</strong>, ensuring Pugsleys remained serviceable long after production ceased.<br />

<p><strong>Announcement &amp; Production</strong><br />
  On January 29, 2018, Surly introduced the <strong>Pugsley 2.0</strong>, billed as “a modern take on a classic.”<br />

<p><strong>Frame Material &amp; Geometry Tweaks</strong><br />
  The Pugsley 2.0 frame remained <strong>4130 Chromoly steel</strong> but featured updated geometry:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>• <strong>Head Tube Length</strong>: Increased to 115–160 mm (S–XL) for a taller stack relieving wrist pressure.<br />
• <strong>Head Tube Angle</strong>: 69.5° (slacker by 1°) for added stability under load.<br />
• <strong>Chainstay Length</strong>: Extended to 460 mm (from ~427 mm) for extra heel clearance when using loaded panniers or winter boots.<br />
“The wheelbase has grown by 11 mm … which helps stabilize the ride under load.”<br />

<p><strong>Dropouts &amp; Hub Compatibility</strong><br />
  The Pugsley 2.0 retained <strong>135 mm spacing</strong> by default, but the <strong>rear dropout now clears 142 × 12 mm thru-axle hubs</strong> using “10/12 mm adapter washers on the ‘Gnot Boost’ spacing.”  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“While the frame ships with 135 mm hubs front and rear, the rear dropout will actually clear a <strong>142 × 12 mm hub</strong>. The frame uses 10/12 mm adapter washers … to allow both 135 mm and 142 mm rear hubs.”<br />

<p><strong>Tire &amp; Fork Compatibility</strong><br />
  Surly added clearance for <strong>4.3″ tires (stock) and up to 4.8″</strong> with the optional Moonlander fork. As explained by Surly:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The frame can now take 4.3″ tires … and if you fit a wider Surly Moonlander fork, you can run 4.8″ tires.”<br />

<p><strong>Head Tube</strong><br />
  The Pugsley 2.0 continued with a <strong>straight 1 1/8″ head tube</strong>. “Despite taller tube lengths and updated geometry, Surly did <strong>not</strong> switch to a tapered steerer.”<br />

   All factory Pugsley frames and forks from 2005 through 2016 used <strong>135 mm spacing</strong>. Any 100 mm forks sold were <strong>aftermarket-only</strong>—no complete Pugsley ever shipped from Surly with a 100 mm front.<br />

   Most “redesigns” between 2005–2016 were spec updates—new paint, updated hubs, drivetrain kits—while core geometry (dropout spacing, head tube, chainstay shape) remained unchanged.<br />
